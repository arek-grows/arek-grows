# Hi, I'm Arek. I'm currently most interested in developing my Python foundational skills and branching out from there.

**ðŸ‘‹ What I seek from other people:**
- I'd like advice and strong criticism! If I can offer advice or criticism to you, I would love to do my best.
- Collaboration
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arektrusz/)
- Maybe some chatting ðŸ˜Š
  - My Discord is Arek#3866

<br>

**ðŸ¥‡ Here are some of my major achievements:**
- Associate's Degree in Computer Programming
- 3 month Data Analytics boot camp certificate
- freeCodeCamp Scientific Coding with Python certificate of completion

<br>

**ðŸ¥ˆ Minor achievements/projects:**
- MapleStory equipment sim project
- 300+ challenges completed on beginner.py Discord
- 100 days of code (shout out Jeanine)
  - simple GUI calc
  - Flask introduction

<br>

**ðŸŒ± Here is what I'm currently learning/doing:**
- Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer course on talkpython.fm
  - to iterate through objects first define their `__iter__` method
  - use generators for creating iterables of uknown or abritrary size
  - *Recursive generators with `yield from`
  - calling `list()` on a generator generates everything in that generator
  - basic generator comprehension syntax: `(<expression> for <var> in <iterable> if <condition>)`
  - using a generator once through comprehensions or expressions uses it up. in order to use it again you must define it again

<br>

**ðŸŒ¼ What I plan to learn/do next:**
- Better familiarize myself with git and PyCharm
- Algorithms and Data Structures in Python
- Better understand the underlying concepts of programming such as memory management etc.
- Decide what to dive deeper into and dive into it (currently heavily leaning into data science)
- Relearn C++ and/or Java and have stronger foundational knowledge in the language
- Start and finish multiple medium to large sized projects (need ideas)
  - Update and pretty up my [portfolio](https://arektrusz.carrd.co/)
- Possibly gain experience/side cash on Upwork
- Network
- Get a software development job !!
