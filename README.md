# Hi, I'm Arek. I'm currently most interested in developing my Python foundational skills and branching out from there.

**👋 What I seek from other people:**
- I'd like advice and strong criticism! If I can offer advice or criticism to you, I would love to do my best.
- Collaboration
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arektrusz/)
- Maybe some chatting 😊
  - My Discord is Arek#3866

<br>

**🥇 Here are some of my major achievements:**
- Associate's Degree in Computer Programming
- 3 month Data Analytics boot camp certificate
- freeCodeCamp Scientific Coding with Python certificate of completion

<br>

**🥈 Minor achievements/projects:**
- MapleStory equipment sim project
- 300+ challenges completed on beginner.py Discord
- 100 days of code (shout out Jeanine)
  - simple GUI calc
  - Flask introduction

<br> 

**🌱 Here is what I'm currently learning/doing:**
- Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer course on talkpython.fm
  - write a `requirements.txt` file in your project folder, which contains the libraries your project requires, on every line in the text file. use `pip install -r` to download these libs on another system
  - protected fields in classes are prefixed with `_`. private fields are prefixed with `__`
  - getters and setters are not pythonic. directly access attributes with `<object>.<attribute>`

<br>

**🌼 What I plan to learn/do next:**
- Better familiarize myself with git and PyCharm
- Algorithms and Data Structures in Python
- Better understand the underlying concepts of programming such as memory management etc.
- Decide what to dive deeper into and dive into it (currently heavily leaning into data science)
- Relearn C++ and/or Java and have stronger foundational knowledge in the language
- Start and finish multiple medium to large sized projects (need ideas)
  - Update and pretty up my [portfolio](https://arektrusz.carrd.co/)
- Possibly gain experience/side cash on Upwork
- Network
- Get a software development job !!
