# Hi, I'm Arek. I'm currently most interested in developing my Python foundational skills and branching out from there.

**ðŸ‘‹ What I seek from other people:**
- I'd like advice and strong criticism! If I can offer advice or criticism to you, I would love to do my best.
- Collaboration
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arektrusz/)
- Maybe some chatting ðŸ˜Š
  - My Discord is Arek#3866

<br>

**ðŸ¥‡ Here are some of my major achievements:**
- Associate's Degree in Computer Programming
- 3 month Data Analytics boot camp certificate
- freeCodeCamp Scientific Coding with Python certificate of completion

<br>

**ðŸ¥ˆ Minor achievements/projects:**
- MapleStory equipment sim project
- 300+ challenges completed on beginner.py Discord
- 100 days of code (shout out Jeanine)
  - simple GUI calc
  - Flask introduction

<br>

**ðŸŒ± Here is what I'm currently learning/doing:**
- Write Pythonic Code Like a Seasoned Developer course on talkpython.fm
  - PEP 8 conventions: code format, descriptive variable/function names
  - docstrings to better document functions, classes, methods
  - truthiness: all 'empty' data is `False` (e.g. `0`, `None`, `[]`), rest is `True`. `__bool__` in a class determines the truthiness
  - exit codes to relay information?
  - flat, not nested. write gaurding clauses
  - when using a for loop, if the looping variable isn't being used, name it `_`
  - use more dictionaries, less lists
  - merging dictionaries syntax: `{**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}`
  - declaring class attributes with `__slots__` saves on time and memory bc the attributes are denied being created as dicts. this is not Pythonic and should only be considered for use when needing to save space in RAM
  - use defaultdict library to safely access dict items. this should always be used in situations when the key your code is accessing has a chance to not exist. consider using the `get()` attribute of dict as well

<br>

**ðŸŒ¼ What I plan to learn/do next:**
- Better familiarize myself with git and PyCharm
- Algorithms and Data Structures in Python
- Better understand the underlying concepts of programming such as memory management etc.
- Decide what to dive deeper into and dive into it (currently heavily leaning into data science)
- Relearn C++ and/or Java and have stronger foundational knowledge in the language
- Start and finish multiple medium to large sized projects (need ideas)
  - Update and pretty up my [portfolio](https://arektrusz.carrd.co/)
- Possibly gain experience/side cash on Upwork
- Network
- Get a software development job !!
